          We are always delighted to support these schools with variety of materials to enhance the learning experience of the learners,<br />

          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          We run our outreaches on a yearly basis, with this being our third edition - we have had the privilege of contributing to the Makoko community, the Pacelli School for the Blind, and the Wesley School for the Hearing Impaired.
          We want them to know that we and many others are rooting for them; we believe in them; and we will keep cheering them on as they progress towards greater heights beyond societal limitations.
